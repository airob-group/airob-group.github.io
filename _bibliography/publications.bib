	{We address the Multi-Robot Motion Planning (MRMP) problem of computing collision-free trajectories for multiple robots in shared continuous environments. While existing frameworks effectively decompose MRMP into singlerobot subproblems, spatiotemporal motion planning with dynamic obstacles remains challenging, particularly in cluttered or narrow-corridor settings. We propose Space-Time Graphs of Convex Sets (ST-GCS), a novel planner that systematically covers the collision-free space-time domain with convex sets instead of relying on random sampling. By extending Graphs of Convex Sets (GCS) into the time dimension, ST-GCS formulates time-optimal trajectories in a unified convex optimization that naturally accommodates velocity bounds and flexible arrival times. We also propose Exact Convex Decomposition (ECD) to "reserve" trajectories as spatiotemporal obstacles, maintaining a collision-free space-time graph of convex sets for subsequent planning. Integrated into two prioritized-planning frameworks, ST-GCS consistently achieves higher success rates and better solution quality than state-of-the-art sampling-based planners—often at orders-of-magnitude faster runtimes—underscoring its benefits for MRMP in challenging settings.

	{Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) aims to arrange collision-free goal-reaching paths for a group of agents. Anytime MAPF solvers based on large neighborhood search (LNS) have gained prominence recently due to their flexibility and scalability, leading to a surge of methods, especially those leveraging machine learning, to enhance neighborhood selection. However, several pitfalls exist and hinder a comprehensive evaluation of these new methods, which mainly include: 1) Lower than actual or incorrect baseline performance; 2) Lack of a unified evaluation setting and criterion; 3) Lack of a codebase or executable model for supervised learning methods. To address these challenges, we introduce a unified evaluation framework, implement prior methods, and conduct an extensive comparison of prominent methods. Our evaluation reveals that rule-based heuristics serve as strong baselines, while current learning-based methods show no clear advantage on time efficiency or improvement capacity. Our extensive analysis also opens up new research opportunities for improving MAPF-LNS, such as targeting high-delayed agents, applying contextual algorithms, optimizing replan order and neighborhood size, where machine learning can potentially be integrated.}

	{We study Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) on a 4-neighbor 2D grid $G$, which aims to compute paths for multiple robots to cover all cells of $G$. Traditional approaches are limited as they first compute coverage trees on a quadrant coarsened grid $\mathcal{H}$ and then employ the Spanning Tree Coverage (STC) paradigm to generate paths on $G$, making them inapplicable to grids with partially obstructed $2 \times 2$ blocks. To address this limitation, we reformulate the problem directly on $G$, revolutionizing grid-based MCPP solving and establishing new NP-hardness results. We introduce Extended-STC (ESTC), a novel paradigm that extends STC to ensure complete coverage with bounded suboptimality, even when $\mathcal{H}$ includes partially obstructed blocks. Furthermore, we present LS-MCPP, a new algorithmic framework that integrates ESTC with three novel types of neighborhood operators within a local search strategy to optimize coverage paths directly on $G$. Unlike prior grid-based MCPP work, our approach also incorporates a versatile post-processing procedure that applies Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) techniques to MCPP for the first time, enabling a fusion of these two important fields in multi-robot coordination. This procedure effectively resolves inter-robot conflicts and accommodates turning costs by solving a MAPF variant, making our MCPP solutions more practical for real-world applications. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly improves solution quality and efficiency, managing up to 100 robots on grids as large as $256 \times 256$ within minutes of runtime. Validation with physical robots confirms the feasibility of our solutions under real-world conditions.

	{We study a decentralized version of Moving Agents in Formation (MAiF), a variant of Multi-Agent Path Finding aiming to plan collision-free paths for multiple agents with the dual objectives of reaching their goals quickly while maintaining a desired formation. The agents must balance these objectives under conditions of partial observation and limited communication. The formation maintenance depends on the joint state of all agents, whose dimensionality increases exponentially with the number of agents, rendering the learning process intractable. Additionally, learning a single policy that can accommodate different linear preferences for these two objectives presents a significant challenge. In this paper, we propose Mean-Field Control with Envelop Q-learning (MFC-EQ), a scalable and adaptable learning framework for this bi-objective multi-agent problem. We approximate the dynamics of all agents using mean-field theory while learning a universal preference-agnostic policy through envelop Q-learning. Our empirical evaluation of MFC-EQ across numerous instances shows that it outperforms state-of-the-art centralized MAiF baselines. Furthermore, MFC-EQ effectively handles more complex scenarios where the desired formation changes dynamically -- a challenge that existing MAiF planners cannot address.}

Our method, MapTracker, accumulates a sensor stream into memory buffers of two latent representations: 1) Raster latents in the bird’s-eye-view (BEV) space and 2) Vector latents over the road elements (i.e., pedestrian-crossings, lane-dividers, and road-boundaries). The approach borrows the query propagation paradigm from the tracking literature that explicitly associates tracked road elements from the previous frame to the current, while fusing a subset of memory latents selected with distance strides to further enhance temporal consistency. A vector latent is decoded to reconstruct the geometry of a road element. The paper further makes benchmark contributions by 1) Improving processing code for existing datasets to produce consistent ground truth with temporal alignments and 2) Augmenting existing mAP metrics with consistency checks. MapTracker significantly outperforms existing methods on both nuScenes and Agroverse2 datasets by over 8\% and 19\% on the conventional and the new consistency-aware metrics, respectively.

	{We introduce the Multi-Robot Connected Fermat Spiral (MCFS), a novel algorithmic framework for Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) that adapts Connected Fermat Spiral (CFS) from the computer graphics community to multi-robot coordination for the first time. MCFS uniquely enables the orchestration of multiple robots to generate coverage paths that contour around arbitrarily shaped obstacles, a feature that is notably lacking in traditional methods. Our framework not only enhances area coverage and optimizes task performance, particularly in terms of makespan, for workspaces rich in irregular obstacles but also addresses the challenges of path continuity and curvature critical for non-holonomic robots by generating smooth paths without decomposing the workspace. MCFS solves MCPP by constructing a graph of isolines and transforming MCPP into a combinatorial optimization problem, aiming to minimize the makespan while covering all vertices. Our contributions include developing a unified CFS version for scalable and adaptable MCPP, extending it to MCPP with novel optimization techniques for cost reduction and path continuity and smoothness, and demonstrating through extensive experiments that MCFS outperforms existing MCPP methods in makespan, path curvature, coverage ratio, and overlapping ratio. Our research marks a significant step in MCPP, showcasing the fusion of computer graphics and automated planning principles to advance the capabilities of multi-robot systems in complex environments.

	{We study graph-based Multi-Robot Coverage Path Planning (MCPP) that aims to compute coverage paths for multiple robots to cover all vertices of a given 2D grid terrain graph $G$. Existing graph-based MCPP algorithms first compute a tree cover on $G$---a forest of multiple trees that cover all vertices---and then employ the Spanning Tree Coverage (STC) paradigm to generate coverage paths on the decomposed graph $D$ of the terrain graph $G$ by circumnavigating the edges of the computed trees, aiming to optimize the makespan (i.e., the maximum coverage path cost among all robots).
	In this paper, we take a different approach by exploring how to systematically search for good coverage paths directly on $D$. We introduce a new algorithmic framework, called LS-MCPP, which leverages a local search to operate directly on $D$. We propose a novel standalone paradigm, Extended-STC (ESTC), that extends STC to achieve complete coverage for MCPP on any decomposed graphs, even those resulting from incomplete terrain graphs. Furthermore, we demonstrate how to integrate ESTC with three novel types of neighborhood operators into our framework to effectively guide its search process. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of LS-MCPP, consistently improving the initial solution returned by two state-of-the-art baseline algorithms that compute suboptimal tree covers on $G$, with a notable reduction in makespan by up to 35.7\% and 30.3\%, respectively. Moreover, LS-MCPP consistently matches or surpasses the results of optimal tree cover computation, achieving these outcomes with orders of magnitude faster runtime, thereby showcasing its significant benefits for large-scale real-world coverage tasks.}

Specifically, we focus on a reduction from MCPP to Min-Max Rooted Tree Cover (MMRTC). For the first time, we propose a Mixed Integer Programming (MIP) model to optimally solve MMRTC, resulting in an MCPP solution with a coverage time that is provably at most four times the optimal. Moreover, we propose two suboptimal yet effective heuristics that reduce the number of variables in the MIP model, thus improving its efficiency for large-scale MCPP instances. We show that both heuristics result in reduced-size MIP models that remain complete (i.e., guaranteed to find a solution if one exists) for all MMRTC instances. Additionally, we explore the use of model optimization warm-startup to further improve the efficiency of both the original MIP model and the reduced-size MIP models. We validate the effectiveness of our MIP-based MCPP planner through experiments that compare it with two state-of-the-art MCPP planners on various instances, demonstrating a reduction in the coverage time by an average of $27.65\%$ and $23.24\%$ over them, respectively.}

	{Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a crucial component for many large-scale robotic systems, where agents must plan their collision-free paths to their given goal positions. Recently, multi-agent reinforcement learning has been introduced to solve the partially observable variant of MAPF by learning a decentralized single-agent policy in a centralized fashion based on each agent's partial observation. However, existing learning-based methods are ineffective in achieving complex multi-agent cooperation, especially in congested environments, due to the non-stationarity of this setting. To tackle this challenge, we propose a multi-agent actor-critic method called Soft Actor-Critic with Heuristic-Based Attention (SACHA), which employs novel heuristic-based attention mechanisms for both the actors and critics to encourage cooperation among agents. SACHA learns a neural network for each agent to selectively pay attention to the shortest path heuristic guidance from multiple agents within its field of view, thereby allowing for more scalable learning of cooperation. SACHA also extends the existing multi-agent actor-critic framework by introducing a novel critic centered on each agent to approximate $Q$-values. Compared to existing methods that use a fully observable critic, our agent-centered multi-agent actor-critic method results in more impartial credit assignment and better generalizability of the learned policy to MAPF instances with varying numbers of agents and types of environments. We also implement SACHA(C), which embeds a communication module in the agent's policy network to enable information exchange among agents. We evaluate both SACHA and SACHA(C) on a variety of MAPF instances and demonstrate decent improvements over several state-of-the-art learning-based MAPF methods with respect to success rate and solution quality.}

	{Purpose of Review Planning collision-free paths for multiple robots is important for real-world multi-robot systems and has been studied as an optimization problem on graphs, called multi-agent path finding (MAPF). This review surveys different categories of classic and state-of-the-art MAPF algorithms and different research attempts to tackle the challenges of generalizing MAPF techniques to real-world scenarios. Recent Findings Solving MAPF problems optimally is computationally challenging. Recent advances have resulted in MAPF algorithms that can compute collision-free paths for hundreds of robots and thousands of navigation tasks in seconds of runtime. Many variants of MAPF have been formalized to adapt MAPF techniques to different real-world requirements, such as considerations of robot kinematics, online optimization for real-time systems, and the integration of task assignment and path planning. Summary Algorithmic techniques for MAPF problems have addressed important aspects of several multi-robot applications, including automated warehouse fulfillment and sortation, automated train scheduling, and navigation of non-holonomic robots and quadcopters.

	{Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is a challenging combinatorial problem that asks us to plan collision-free paths for a team of cooperative agents. In this work, we show that one of the reasons why MAPF is so hard to solve is due to a phenomenon called pairwise symmetry, which occurs when two agents have many different paths to their target locations, all of which appear promising, but every combination of them results in a collision. We identify several classes of pairwise symmetries and show that each one arises commonly in practice and can produce an exponential explosion in the space of possible collision resolutions, leading to unacceptable runtimes for current state-of-the-art (bounded-sub)optimal MAPF algorithms. We propose a variety of reasoning techniques that detect the symmetries efficiently as they arise and resolve them by using specialized constraints to eliminate all permutations of pairwise colliding paths in a single branching step. We implement these ideas in the context of a leading optimal MAPF algorithm CBS and show that the addition of the symmetry reasoning techniques can have a dramatic positive effect on its performance — we report a reduction in the number of node expansions by up to four orders of magnitude and an increase in scalability by up to thirty times. These gains allow us to solve to optimality a variety of challenging MAPF instances previously considered out of reach for CBS.

	{Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is essential
to large-scale robotic systems. Recent methods have applied
reinforcement learning (RL) to learn decentralized polices in
partially observable environments. A fundamental challenge of
obtaining collision-free policy is that agents need to learn cooperation to handle congested situations. This paper combines
communication with deep Q-learning to provide a novel learning based method for MAPF, where agents achieve cooperation
via graph convolution. To guide RL algorithm on long-horizon
goal-oriented tasks, we embed the potential choices of shortest
paths from single source as heuristic guidance instead of using a
specific path as in most existing works. Our method treats each
agent independently and trains the model from a single agent’s
perspective. The final trained policy is applied to each agent for
decentralized execution. The whole system is distributed during
training and is trained under a curriculum learning strategy.
Empirical evaluation in obstacle-rich environment indicates the
high success rate with low average step of our method.}

the queue of that station to obtain a parcel for delivery, and
then deliver the parcel to a sorting bin. The throughput of
such centers is largely determined by the total idle time of all
stations since their queues can frequently become empty. To
address this problem, we first formalize and study the oneshot version that assigns stations to a set of agents and finds
collision-free paths for the agents to their assigned stations.
We present efficient algorithms for this task based on a novel
min-cost max-flow formulation that minimizes the total idle
time of all stations in a fixed time window. We then demonstrate how our algorithms for solving the one-shot problem
can be applied to solving the lifelong problem as well. Experimentally, we believe to be the first researchers to consider real-world automated sortation centers using an industrial simulator with realistic data and a kinodynamic model
of real robots. On this simulator, we showcase the benefits of
our algorithms by demonstrating their efficiency and effectiveness for up to 350 agents.}

congested environments. In this paper, we develop a two-phase
search algorithm, called SWARM-MAPF, whose first phase is inspired by swarm-based algorithms (in open regions) and whose
second phase is inspired by multi-agent path-finding (MAPF) algorithms (in congested regions). In the first phase, SWARM-MAPF
selects a leader among the agents and finds a path for it that is
sufficiently far away from the obstacles so that the other agents
can preserve the desired formation around it. It also identifies the
critical segments of the leader’s path where the other agents cannot preserve the desired formation and the refinement of which
has thus to be delegated to the second phase. In the second phase,
SWARM-MAPF refines these segments. Theoretically, we prove that
SWARM-MAPF is complete. Empirically, we show that SWARM-MAPF scales well and is able to find close-to-optimal solutions.}

one order of magnitude.}

	{Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) has been widely studied
in the AI community. For example, Conflict-Based Search
(CBS) is a state-of-the-art MAPF algorithm based on a twolevel tree-search. However, previous MAPF algorithms assume that an agent occupies only a single location at any
given time, e.g., a single cell in a grid. This limits their applicability in many real-world domains that have geometric
agents in lieu of point agents. Geometric agents are referred
to as "large" agents because they can occupy multiple points
at the same time. In this paper, we formalize and study LA-MAPF, i.e., MAPF for large agents. We first show how CBS
can be adapted to solve LA-MAPF. We then present a generalized version of CBS, called Multi-Constraint CBS (MC-CBS), that adds multiple constraints (instead of one constraint) for an agent when it generates a high-level search
node. We introduce three different approaches to choose
such constraints as well as an approach to compute admissible heuristics for the high-level search. Experimental results show that all MC-CBS variants outperform CBS by up
to three orders of magnitude in terms of runtime. The best
variant also outperforms EPEA* (a state-of-the-art A*-based

Therefore, we present two novel offline MAPD algorithms that improve

MAPD algorithms first compute one task sequence for each agent by solving
a special traveling salesman problem and then plan paths according to these
task sequences. We also introduce an effective deadlock avoidance method,
called "reserving dummy paths." Theoretically, our MAPD algorithms are

	{Multi-Agent Path Finding (MAPF) is the planning problem
of finding collision-free paths for a team of agents. We focus on Conflict-Based Search (CBS), a two-level tree-search
state-of-the-art MAPF algorithm. The standard splitting strategy used by CBS is not disjoint, i.e., when it splits a problem
into two subproblems, some solutions are shared by both subproblems, which can create duplication of search effort. In
this paper, we demonstrate how to improve CBS with disjoint
splitting and how to modify the low-level search of CBS to
take maximal advantage of it. Experiments show that disjoint
splitting increases the success rates and speeds of CBS and
its variants by up to 2 orders of magnitude.}

	{The Multi-Agent Pathfinding (MAPF) problem is the fundamental problem of planning paths for multiple agents, where
the key constraint is that the agents will be able to follow
these paths concurrently without colliding with each other.
Applications of MAPF include automated warehouses and
autonomous vehicles. Research on MAPF has been flourishing in the past couple of years. Different MAPF research papers make different assumptions, e.g., whether agents can traverse the same road at the same time, and have different objective functions, e.g., minimize makespan or sum of agents’
actions costs. These assumptions and objectives are sometimes implicitly assumed or described informally. This makes
it difficult to establish appropriate baselines for comparison in
research papers, as well as making it difficult for practitioners
to find the papers relevant to their concrete application. This
paper aims to fill this gap and support researchers and practitioners by providing a unifying terminology for describing
common MAPF assumptions and objectives. In addition, we
also provide pointers to two MAPF benchmarks. In particular, we introduce a new grid-based benchmark for MAPF,
and demonstrate experimentally that it poses a challenge to
contemporary MAPF algorithms.}

	{Focal search (FS) is a bounded-suboptimal search

f-values. Unlike A*, it also uses a focal list containing all states from the open list whose f-values
are no larger than a suboptimality factor times the
smallest f-value in the open list. In this paper, we
develop an anytime version of FS, called anytime
FS (AFS), that is useful when deliberation time is
limited. AFS finds a "good" solution quickly and
refines it to better and better solutions if time allows. It does this refinement efficiently by reusing
previous search efforts. On the theoretical side, we
show that AFS is bounded suboptimal and that anytime potential search (ATPS/ANA*), a state-of-theart anytime bounded-cost search (BCS) variant of
A*, is a special case of AFS. In doing so, we bridge
the gap between anytime search algorithms based
on BSS and BCS. We also identify different properties of priority functions, used to sort the focal
list, that may allow for efficient reuse of previous search efforts. On the experimental side, we
demonstrate the usefulness of AFS for solving hard
combinatorial problems, such as the generalized
covering traveling salesman problem and the multi-agent pathfinding problem.}

	{The multi-agent path-finding (MAPF) problem has recently
received a lot of attention. However, it does not capture
important characteristics of many real-world domains, such
as automated warehouses, where agents are constantly
engaged with new tasks. In this paper, we therefore study
a lifelong version of the MAPF problem, called the multi-agent pickup and delivery (MAPD) problem. In the MAPD
problem, agents have to attend to a stream of delivery tasks
in an online setting. One agent has to be assigned to each
delivery task. This agent has to first move to a given pickup
location and then to a given delivery location while avoiding
collisions with other agents. We present two decoupled
MAPD algorithms, Token Passing (TP) and Token Passing
with Task Swaps (TPTS). Theoretically, we show that they
solve all well-formed MAPD instances, a realistic subclass
of MAPD instances. Experimentally, we compare them
against a centralized strawman MAPD algorithm without
this guarantee in a simulated warehouse system. TP can
easily be extended to a fully distributed MAPD algorithm
and is the best choice when real-time computation is of primary concern since it remains efficient for MAPD instances
with hundreds of agents and tasks. TPTS requires limited
communication among agents and balances well between TP
and the centralized MAPD algorithm.}

Each agent has to move to exactly one target given to its

assign all agents in a single team to targets and plan
their paths. On the high level, CBM uses conflict-based
search to resolve collisions among agents in different teams.
Theoretically, we prove that CBM is correct, complete and

	{This paper explores the problem of managing movements of
aircraft along the surface of busy airports. Airport surface
management is a complex logistics problem involving the
coordination of humans and machines. The work described
here arose from the idea that autonomous towing vehicles for
taxiing aircraft could offer a solution to the ’capacity problem’ for busy airports, the problem of getting more efficient
use of existing surface area to meet increasing demand. Supporting autonomous surface operations requires continuous
planning, scheduling and monitoring of operations, as well
as systems for optimizing complex human-machine interaction. We identify a set of computational subproblems of the
surface management problem that would benefit from recent
advances in multi-agent planning and scheduling and probabilistic predictive modeling, and discuss preliminary work
at integrating these components into a prototype of a surface
management system.}

	{Path planning for multiple robots is well studied
in the AI and robotics communities. For a given discretized
environment, robots need to find collision-free paths to a set
of specified goal locations. Robots can be fully anonymous,
non-anonymous, or organized in groups. Although powerful
solvers for this abstract problem exist, they make simplifying assumptions by ignoring kinematic constraints, making it
difficult to use the resulting plans on actual robots. In this
paper, we present a solution which takes kinematic constraints,
such as maximum velocities, into account, while guaranteeing
a user-specified minimum safety distance between robots. We
demonstrate our approach in simulation and on real robots in
2D and 3D environments.}

	{Planning in large partially observable Markov decision processes (POMDPs) is challenging especially when a long
planning horizon is required. A few recent algorithms successfully tackle this case but at the expense of a weaker
information-gathering capacity. In this paper, we propose <i>Information Gathering and Reward Exploitation of Subgoals</i>
(IGRES), a randomized POMDP planning algorithm that
leverages information in the state space to automatically generate "macro-actions" to tackle tasks with long planning horizons, while locally exploring the belief space to allow effective information gathering. Experimental results show that
IGRES is an effective multi-purpose POMDP solver, providing state-of-the-art performance for both long horizon planning tasks and information-gathering tasks on benchmark domains. Additional experiments with an ecological adaptive
management problem indicate that IGRES is a promising tool
for POMDP planning in real-world settings.}
